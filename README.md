**Are the external references still available?**

Hey There!

> This project is a kind of double verification in the best 'Inception' style. *How is that?*

> Having a list of pages, this script checks the status (200 / 404 or any other) of another list of pages inside each initial page

> For this case, we want to know if the external references of some Wikipedia pages are still alive or find the broken ones, those with status 404

> Also, the script checks if each ref link has the rel attribute "nofollow" as we should expect


*Is that not enough?*

Finally, we get notifications via Slack to take some actions, as simple as it sounds. Less is more. 

Potentials are around the way. 
Every feedback or question is welcome :) 


*Note: To run it locally, you can use your own Slack Webhook* **
